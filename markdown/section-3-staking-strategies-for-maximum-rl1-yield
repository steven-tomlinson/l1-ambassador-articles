Section 3: Staking Strategies for Maximum RL1 Yield

Optimizing Staking to Maximize RL1 Rewards

Given that early staking provides higher yields, and staking multipliers reward longer commitments, an optimal strategy must balance timing, duration, and reinvestment to maximize RL1 earnings.

This section explores staking strategies that yield the highest possible rewards while maintaining flexibility for liquidity needs.

Strategy 1: The “Early and Long” Approach

Best For: Long-term investors who want maximum staking power.

How It Works:
✅ Stake as early as possible in a new cycle.
✅ Commit to longer durations (180-365 days) to benefit from higher multipliers.
✅ Avoid unstaking or withdrawing, allowing rewards to compound over multiple cycles.

Why It Works:
   •   Maximizes early staking advantages (higher RL1 share before dilution).
   •   Locks in the highest staking multipliers, significantly increasing staking power.
   •   Best for compounding rewards, since longer stakes accumulate over multiple cycles.

Downsides:
   •   No flexibility—funds are locked until the staking period ends.
   •   Misses out on new opportunities if network staking dynamics change.

Strategy 2: The “Rolling Stakes” Approach

Best For: Users who want steady income while keeping liquidity.

How It Works:
✅ Instead of staking everything at once, create staggered stakes over time (e.g., every 30-90 days).
✅ Use different durations (90, 180, and 365 days) to keep a rolling cycle of unlocking tokens.
✅ Reinvest unlocked RL1 and LL1 daily to maintain and grow staking power.

Why It Works:
   •   Ensures consistent RL1 income, as some stakes unlock each cycle.
   •   Reduces risk of staking at a bad time (e.g., right before a major dilution event).
   •   Gives flexibility—users can adjust strategy as network conditions evolve.

Example of a Rolling Stake Strategy:

Date	Stake Amount	Duration	Unlocks On
Cycle Start	500,000 L1	365 Days	Next Year
Day 30	250,000 L1	180 Days	6 Months Later
Day 60	250,000 L1	90 Days	Next Cycle
Day 90	250,000 L1	365 Days	Next Year
Ongoing	Re-stake RL1 & LL1	180 Days	Continuous

🔹 Result: A steady unlocking and re-staking flow, allowing for continuous RL1 earnings while maintaining flexibility.

Strategy 3: The “Max Efficiency” Approach

Best For: Users who want to optimize staking power while keeping some funds liquid.

How It Works:
✅ Stake all unlocked RL1 daily to avoid idle funds.
✅ Use a mix of 180 and 365-day stakes to maximize staking power while maintaining some liquidity.
✅ Avoid unstaking to preserve multiplier effects and compounding benefits.

Why It Works:
   •   Eliminates inefficiency—no unlocked RL1 is wasted.
   •   Balances yield and flexibility—mixing 180-day and 365-day stakes gives both high rewards and liquidity.
   •   Works well in fluctuating staking conditions, adapting to changes in total staked L1.

Example Portfolio:

Stake Type	L1 Allocated	Staking Duration	RL1 Yield Boost
Core Stake	500,000	365 Days	Maximum
Mid-Term Stake	300,000	180 Days	High
Re-staked RL1	Daily Unlocks	90-180 Days	Ongoing

🔹 Result: Maximized RL1 rewards without locking everything in for a year.

Comparing Staking Strategies: Which One is Best?

Strategy	Pros	Cons	Best For
Early & Long	Highest staking power, maximizes compounding	No flexibility, funds are locked long-term	Long-term investors
Rolling Stakes	Continuous income, risk mitigation	Requires tracking multiple unlock periods	Users wanting consistent RL1 earnings
Max Efficiency	No idle funds, optimal balance of yield & liquidity	Requires daily re-staking	Active users who can manage their stakes

Verdict:
   •   For Maximum Yield → Early & Long strategy
   •   For Balancing Yield & Flexibility → Rolling Stakes
   •   For Highest Efficiency → Max Efficiency

Key Takeaways:

✅ Early staking provides the best RL1 rewards—always stake at the beginning of a cycle when possible.
✅ Longer durations yield higher staking power but reduce liquidity.
✅ Rolling and re-staking strategies can balance yield and flexibility.
✅ Reinvesting unlocked RL1 daily ensures no loss of earning potential.
