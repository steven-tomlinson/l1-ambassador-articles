Section 5: Balancing Yield vs. Liquidity in Staking

The Trade-Off Between Maximum Rewards and Token Accessibility

Staking in Lamina1 presents a fundamental trade-off:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Higher staking multipliers (365 days) yield more RL1 but lock up L1 for a long time.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Shorter staking durations provide liquidity but lower total staking power.

This section explores how to balance yield and liquidity, ensuring that stakers maximize earnings without limiting access to funds.

1. Understanding the Liquidity-Yield Spectrum

Yield Maximization vs. Liquidity Maximization

Staking Strategy	Yield Potential	Liquidity Access	Risk Level
365-day staking (max multiplier)	ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼ Very High	ðŸ”½ None (Fully Locked)	ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼ High
180-day staking	ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼ High	ðŸ”½ Low (Unlocks in 6 months)	ðŸ”¼ Medium
90-day staking	ðŸ”¼ Moderate	ðŸ”¼ Moderate	ðŸ”½ Low
Rolling 30-90 day stakes	ðŸ”½ Lower	ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼ High	ðŸ”½ðŸ”½ Very Low

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Longer stakes maximize RL1 but reduce access to liquid L1.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Shorter stakes provide flexibility but reduce total RL1 earnings.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â A mixed approach can balance rewards with liquidity needs.

2. The Hybrid Staking Model: A Balanced Approach

The Hybrid Staking Model allows for both high yield and liquidity access by dividing funds into multiple stake durations.

Example Hybrid Portfolio Allocation:

Stake Type	L1 Allocated	Staking Duration	Purpose
Core Long-Term Stake	50%	365 Days	Maximize RL1 yield
Mid-Term Flexible Stake	25%	180 Days	Mid-range yield & moderate liquidity
Short-Term Rotating Stake	15%	90 Days	Regular liquidity unlocks
Liquid Reserve (Unstaked)	10%	No Stake	Available for emergency use

Why This Works:

âœ… 50% is locked for maximum staking power (365 days).
âœ… 25% unlocks every 6 months (180 days), ensuring periodic liquidity.
âœ… 15% unlocks every 3 months (90 days), providing short-term flexibility.
âœ… 10% remains unstaked for immediate access if needed.

Liquidity Impact:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Every 3 months, some L1 unlocks from short-term stakes.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Every 6 months, a larger portion unlocks, providing financial flexibility.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Every year, the highest-yield stake matures, maximizing RL1 yield.

This model ensures that stakers never have to fully unstake and can always reinvest unlocked L1 for compounding effects.

3. Dynamic Liquidity Adjustment Strategy

Liquidity needs can change over time due to market conditions, personal financial needs, or governance shifts. The Dynamic Liquidity Adjustment method lets users adjust their staking portfolio based on real-world factors.

How to Adjust Based on Liquidity Needs:

Scenario	Adjustment Strategy
Need more liquidity?	Reduce 365-day stake and increase 90-day or unstaked funds.
RL1 yield rates drop?	Shift to shorter stakes for flexibility.
Network staking increases (dilution risk)?	Increase 365-day stakes before rewards drop further.
Personal financial flexibility needed?	Keep 15-20% of L1 unstaked or in 30-90 day rolling stakes.

4. The Emergency Liquidity Plan: When You Need Funds Fast

In emergencies, a fully staked portfolio leaves no room for quick L1 access. Having an Emergency Liquidity Plan ensures you never need to prematurely unstake (and lose multipliers).

How to Structure an Emergency Plan:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Keep 10-15% of L1 unstaked for instant access.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â If necessary, use 90-day stakes as an emergency liquidity buffer.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Never unstake long-term stakes early unless absolutely needed, since this wastes multipliers and RL1 yield.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight: If you follow the Hybrid Staking Model, you will always have L1 unlocking soon, reducing the risk of financial inflexibility.

5. Advanced Liquidity Planning Using Rolling Stakes

To avoid liquidity shortages, you can use Rolling Stakes with frequent unlock cycles.

Rolling Stake Example (Unlocks Every Month):

Date	Stake Amount	Duration	Unlock Date
Jan 1	100K L1	90 Days	Apr 1
Feb 1	100K L1	90 Days	May 1
Mar 1	100K L1	90 Days	June 1

ðŸ”¹ Result: You now have 100K L1 unlocking every month, ensuring liquidity while maintaining yield.

6. Liquidity vs. Yield: Which Approach is Right for You?

Staking Profile	Recommended Approach
Maximize RL1 yield with no liquidity concern	100% 365-day stakes
High yield with moderate liquidity	Hybrid Staking Model (50%-365d, 25%-180d, 15%-90d, 10% unstaked)
Balanced staking with rolling liquidity	Rolling 90-180 day stakes
Liquidity-focused staking	Primarily 90-day stakes with some 30-day flexibility
Immediate liquidity at all times	Minimal staking, keeping L1 unstaked for transactions

Key Takeaways:

âœ… Longer stakes yield more RL1 but reduce liquidity.
âœ… A balanced hybrid approach provides both yield and periodic access to L1.
âœ… Rolling stakes allow for frequent unlocks while maintaining a high yield.
âœ… An Emergency Liquidity Plan prevents the need for premature unstaking.
