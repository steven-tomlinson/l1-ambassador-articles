Section 6: Staking and Governance â€“ The Role of VOTE Tokens

How Staking Impacts Governance in Lamina1

Beyond earning RL1 rewards, staking in Lamina1 plays a crucial role in governance. By staking L1, participants can lock tokens to obtain VOTE tokens, which provide decision-making power over network policies, economic incentives, and ecosystem development.

This section explores:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â How staking influences governance participation
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The mechanics of VOTE tokens and decision-making
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Trade-offs between staking for rewards vs. governance power

1. What Are VOTE Tokens and How Do They Work?

VOTE tokens are soulbound governance tokensâ€”they cannot be transferred and are only issued to users who lock their staked L1 for governance participation.

How to Obtain VOTE Tokens

âœ… Stake L1 â†’ Choose to lock it for governance â†’ Receive VOTE tokens
âœ… VOTE tokens are proportional to the amount and duration of L1 locked.

Formula for VOTE Allocation:
ï¿¼

Governance Influence Based on VOTE Holdings
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â More VOTE = More decision-making power.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Users vote on OMMA & OMAC proposals, deciding economic incentives, RL1 issuance rates, treasury allocations, and funding for projects.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â VOTE is non-transferable, meaning only actively participating stakers influence governance.

2. Governance Decision-Making: What Can Stakers Vote On?

Lamina1 Governance Structure:

Governing Body	Role	VOTE Token Influence
Open Metaverse Monetary Authority (OMMA)	Manages RL1 issuance, staking rewards, inflation control	Voters influence economic policy decisions
Open Metaverse Arts Council (OMAC)	Allocates funding for creators and developers	Voters decide project funding & ecosystem growth
Network Proposals	Changes to staking mechanisms, security measures	Voters approve or reject proposals

Key Takeaway:
Stakers who commit L1 to governance via VOTE tokens directly shape Lamina1â€™s economic and creative ecosystem.

3. Trade-offs: Staking for Governance vs. Staking for Maximum RL1 Yield

While staking for RL1 maximization focuses on earning rewards, staking for governance participation prioritizes influence over the ecosystemâ€™s future.

Pros and Cons of Staking for Governance vs. Yield:

Staking Focus	Pros	Cons
RL1 Yield Maximization (365-day stakes, no VOTE tokens)	Highest staking power, maximum RL1 earnings	No governance influence
Balanced Approach (Some L1 locked for VOTE, some for RL1)	Earn RL1 while gaining governance power	Reduces staking power slightly
Full Governance Commitment (Majority of L1 locked for VOTE)	Maximum decision-making influence	Lower RL1 earnings

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â If you care more about passive rewards, stake without VOTE participation.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â If you want decision-making power, lock L1 for governance participation.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â A hybrid approach allows for both governance participation and passive rewards.

4. How to Balance Staking for Governance and Rewards

A strategic approach can allow users to earn RL1 rewards while also maintaining influence over governance decisions.

Hybrid Model: Balancing Staking for Yield and Governance

Stake Type	L1 Allocated	Purpose
Staked for Maximum RL1 Yield	70%	Earn the highest staking rewards
Staked for VOTE Participation	25%	Gain governance influence
Unstaked Liquidity	5%	Keep liquid for flexibility

ðŸ”¹ Result: You maximize RL1 earnings while still holding governance power.

5. Long-Term Impact of Governance on Staking

Lamina1â€™s governance model directly affects staking conditions, meaning that participating in governance allows stakers to influence their own rewards.

Examples of Governance Decisions Affecting Stakers:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Adjusting RL1 issuance rates: A governance proposal could increase or decrease RL1 rewards, impacting staking yields.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Altering staking multipliers: If OMMA adjusts multipliers for different durations, staking efficiency could change.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Funding ecosystem projects: OMAC decisions could boost platform adoption, increasing L1 demand and long-term staking rewards.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight: By participating in governance, stakers can actively shape the future of their own staking returns.

6. Conclusion: The Best Strategy for You

The choice between staking for RL1 rewards vs. staking for governance power depends on your long-term goals.

If you wantâ€¦	Then you shouldâ€¦
Maximum RL1 yield	Stake L1 for 365 days without locking for governance
Balanced rewards & governance	Stake some L1 for VOTE tokens while keeping a majority for RL1 yield
Full governance power	Lock most L1 for VOTE tokens, accepting lower RL1 yield

Key Takeaways:

âœ… Staking L1 allows users to earn RL1 rewards OR obtain VOTE tokens for governance.
âœ… VOTE tokens provide decision-making power over Lamina1â€™s economic policies.
âœ… Governance participation influences staking rewards, RL1 issuance, and funding decisions.
âœ… A hybrid approach allows users to balance governance influence with staking yield.
